# twittersummarizer

This is the source for the web interface for the TwitterNLP project – an assignment for *CSC421: Natural Language Processing* at NTU.

The application is also deployed on Heroku and can be found at: http://twittersummarizer.herokuapp.com.

Unfortunately, due to the storage constraints of the free tier of Heroku, we only have a very small subset of our data there. Only a few queries, such as “iPad” or “iPad air” will give worthwhile results. This serves 
to give an idea as to how the final application should look like after the local deployment.
